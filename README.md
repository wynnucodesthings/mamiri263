# Introduction
### Hi, I'm an indie developer. I make a bit of everything.
I usually post projects that are worth posting on GitHub. Some might be really old projects that I found on my hard drive, and some might be new projects I'm working on.
I'm currently in high school, so the workload that I have in school doesn't allow me to code as much as I used to before.
# Experience and knowledge
#### Languages:
- javascript, java, python, kotlin, lua and c#.
#### Programs and platforms:
- Servers, postgresql, docker, rest api and linux operating systems
