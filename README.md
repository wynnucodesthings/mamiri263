# Introduction
- Hi, I'm M a hobby programer. I program a bit of everything.
- I'm planning to post any project that I make. some might be really old projects that I found in my hard drive and some might be new projects I'm working on, they are all open source so you may use them if you want.
- I'm currently in highschool so the workload that I have in school doesn't allow me to code as much as I used to before.
# Experience and knowledge

- javascript, java, python, kotlin, lua and c#.
#### I have also used programs and platforms like:
- AWS, mySQL, docker, rest api, linux operating systems and git
